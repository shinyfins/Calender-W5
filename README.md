# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This program is meant to establish foundational skills needed to access and leverage api's to our WILL.
<br>
This program will allow the user to choose dates and notes to catalog in the columns. 
<br>
Ofcourse we will allow personalization so the user can edit and change for the busy schedule they have.

All the info will be saved in the local storage.
